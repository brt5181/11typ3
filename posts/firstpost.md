## **How to Get NodeJS**

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9xlicw9d2oxybeshqvbv.png)
Here is a link to NodeJS [NodeJS Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) After you get to the website click on LTS version and follow the instructions for installation after the download is complete. 

## **What is NodeJS**
From my understanding NodeJS is used to make a simplified scalable server to make it easier for a web developer to scale a website using javascript. It helps to save time by automating processes that could become very time-consuming. 

## **How to Get NPM**
NPM is a very simple installation Process. All you have to do is open terminal (For Mac and Linux users) and type in the following: 

```
npm install

```

If you want to verify that NPM was successfully installed. Type into terminal: 
`npm -v` This will give you the version that your system is running if it was successfully downloaded

## **open-wc**
open-wc allows you to create a blank project in a very quick and easy manner. The command used to create a new project.
Here is a link to the video that helped walk me though creating a development environment: [EdTechJoker: Intro to tooling and getting started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_mio0e6v1g )

```
npm init @open-wc
```

## **What is NPM**
NPM also know as Node Package Manager. The name is very self explanatory, It manages the Packages for the website that you are trying to create. It manages thousands of packages that help to save the developer a lot of time by automating that process for them. Npm also allows you to view the "Finished View" of your work by using the command `npm start`

Myself being new to web development, I was able to create a simple local host using the `npm start` command.

## **VS Code**
Visual Studio Code is a great coding environment to add/edit your project. It it very helpful color coding different parts of you code and also has a debugging feature that could help you with errors within your code.

## **Lit**
Lit is a great resource to help you get started with learning JavaScript and HTML. here is a link to what I had used to get familiar with a simple project. [Lit Intro to JS and walkthrough](https://lit.dev/playground/#sample=examples/full-component)
